# PyTorch MLP and CNN Training Pipeline

This project implements a complete and modular deep learning pipeline in **PyTorch**, designed for training, evaluating, and comparing feedforward neural networks (MLPs), standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and CNNs with residual blocks on the **FashionMNIST** dataset.

The models and training logic are implemented using PyTorch best practices, with support for visualizations and hyperparameter tuning.
