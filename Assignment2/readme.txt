In this assignment you shall develop an automated framework for training and evaluating basic NN models.

Unlike in assignment 1, you can (you should) use the full functionality of PyTorch and all its packages to develop the complete pipeline starting from data preparation, through all the steps we discussed in the course, to the final model evaluation.

The details of the assignment are explained in the two jupyter notebooks in this folder. 

1) Begin with the feed forward model in mlp.ipynb
2) Follow with the cnn model in cnn.ipynb
